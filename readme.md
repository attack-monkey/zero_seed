### Generating components

There is a snippets folder that contains a my-feature folder. This folder is a component template. Copy and paste the folder where ever you need a new component. Then replace `my-feature` with the name of your component. Do this for the component folder name, .component.js name, .template.html name, and the reference to the template within .component.js file.
